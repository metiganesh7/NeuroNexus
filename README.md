üí≥ Credit Card Fraud Detection

üìå Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of fraud datasets (very few fraud cases compared to legitimate ones), special techniques such as oversampling and anomaly detection are applied to improve accuracy.

üéØ Project Objectives
1.Detect Fraudulent Transactions:
Accurately identify credit card transactions that are potentially fraudulent based on historical data.

2.Handle Imbalanced Data:
Address the issue of class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE to ensure the model is sensitive to rare fraud cases.

3.Apply Machine Learning Models:
Train and evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to compare performance.

4.Feature Engineering & Scaling:
Analyze and preprocess input features (e.g., Amount, Time, PCA components) to optimize model performance.

5.Evaluate with Relevant Metrics:
Use precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC to assess how well the model identifies fraud cases.

6.Build a Generalizable Pipeline:
Create a reusable and scalable pipeline for fraud detection that can be adapted to new data.

7.Minimize False Negatives:
Ensure that the model minimizes the chance of failing to detect actual frauds (which can be very costly).
